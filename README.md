### Useful Bits
To print the name of your currently checked out branch in your prompt, include this line as part of your `PS1`:

```bash
git branch 2>/dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
```


### Extras
A few people also asked about @patrickmckenna's Terminal.app theme. He uses [ocean-terminal](https://github.com/mdo/ocean-terminal). His `PS1` (prompt) is

```bash
export PS1="\[\$(tput bold)\]\[\$(tput setaf 6)\]\w\[\$(tput setaf 3)\]\$(git branch 2>/dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/')\[\$(tput setaf 6)\] > \[\$(tput sgr0)\]"
```
